We explore the ability of large language models (LMs) in generating sequential questions for guiding math word problem-solving. We propose various guided question generation schemes based on input conditioning and reinforcement learning and found that on both automatic and human quality evaluations, LMs constrained with desirable question properties generate superior questions and improve the overall performance of a math word problem solver.

All experiments are performed on [GSM8K Dataset](https://github.com/openai/grade-school-math).
