{"question": "Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?", "answer": "How many hours of overtime pay does Eliza receive? ** Eliza is entitled to 45 -40 = <<45-40=5>>5 hours overtime pay.\nHow much is Eliza's overtime rate? ** Her hourly rate for the overtime pay is $10 x 1.2 = $<<10*1.2=12>>12.\nHow much will Eliza receive in overtime pay? ** So, Eliza will receive $12 x 5 =$<<12*5=60>>60 for overtime pay.\nHow much is Eliza's regular weekly earning? ** Her regular weekly earning is $10 x 40 = $<<10*40=400>>400.\nHow much are Eliza's earnings for this week? ** Thus, Eliza will receive a total of $400 + $60 = $<<400+60=460>>460 for this week's work.\n#### 460"}
